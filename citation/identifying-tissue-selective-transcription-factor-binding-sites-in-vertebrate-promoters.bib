	abstract = {We present a computational method aimed at systematically identifying tissue-selective transcription factor binding sites. Our method focuses on the differences between sets of promoters that are associated with differentially expressed genes, and it is effective at identifying the highly degenerate motifs that characterize vertebrate transcription factor binding sites. Results on simulated data indicate that our method detects motifs with greater accuracy than the leading methods, and its detection of strongly overrepresented motifs is nearly perfect. We present motifs identified by our method as the most overrepresented in promoters of liver- and muscle-selective genes, demonstrating that our method accurately identifies known transcription factor binding sites and previously uncharacterized motifs.},
