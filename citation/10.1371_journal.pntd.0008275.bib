    abstract = {Author summary Diseases caused by parasitic worms such as the filariae are among the leading causes of morbidity in the developing world. Very little is known about how development is regulated in these vector-transmitted parasites. We have developed a computational method to identify motifs that correspond to transcription factor binding sites in the genome of the parasitic worm, Brugia malayi, one of the causative agents of lymphatic filariasis. Using this approach, we were able to predict stage-specific transcription factor binding sites involved in a stage of the molting process important for the establishment of the infection. We validated the role of these motifs using an in vitro molting system.},
